Question answering is a natural language understanding task. Question answering models allow users to search for an answer in a document. There are two question answering types, one is open-domain question answering, and the other one is closed domain question answering. Open-domain question answering models are not restricted to a specific domain, meanwhile closed-domain questions answering models are restricted to a specific domain (e.g. legal, medical documents). According to taking context information, there are two types of question answering problems. Open book question answering models take a context with a question where answer is extracted by the context. Closed book question answering models takes no context and are expected to know answer to question, and generate the answer rather than extracting. There are various question answering variants based on the input and output they return, being, extractive question answering (that is solved with BERT-like models), generative question answering (that is solved with models like BART and T5) and Table Question Answering (solved with TAPAS model).
The below schema illustrates extractive, open book question answering. The model takes a context and the question and extract the answer from the given context.
