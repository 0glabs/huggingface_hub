# Interfaces

This folder contains the definition files (written in Typescript) & widgets for the huggingface.co hub's:
- **pipeline types** (used to determine which widget to display on the model page, and which inference API to run)
- **default widget inputs** (when they aren't provided in the model card)
- definitions and UI elements for **third party libraries**.
- **widgets** (used to allow trying out a model on the model page, powered by [Accelerated Inference API](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/docs/python/html/index.html))

Please add to any of those definitions by opening a PR. Thanks 🔥


⚠️ The hub's definitive doc is at https://huggingface.co/docs.
